						<p>Say, do you ever wish you could have beer for breakfast, and not in a shameful 'it's almost noon' way, but rather in a sophisticated and classy manner? Do I hear a resounding yes? Then, dear reader, have I got a solution for you!</p>

					<p>The solution is pretty simple - I said "have beer", not "drink beer", and to be more specific eat it. That's right, eat beer, baked into a loaf of delicious sourdough bread.</p>

					<p>I've been experimenting with sourdough breads for a while now, and I have been maintaining my own rye starter. (For more information on <a href="http://tartine-bread.blogspot.ca/2013/02/9-days.html" target="_blank" title="Sourdough Starter">sourdough starters,</a> check out Francis-Olive's <a href="http://girlmeetsrye.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank" title="Girl Meets Rye">excellent blog Girl Meets Rye</a>.) Almost always my recipe follows the same pattern - starter, 80% wholewheat, 20% white flour, water and salt. The loaf you see here has one significant departure - the liquid used was not water, but rather a craft Ontario stout. And, to add an extra zing, half a pound of cheese. The results were, if I may say so myself, delectable.</p>

					<p>Anyone who has baked bread knows that it's not a particularly hard or laborious, but rather long and patience creating process. Assuming you already have some vigorous starter (and if you don't, I'd again refer you to Girl Meets Rye), the entire process from start to finish will take roughly 24 hours.</p>

					<p>Start your bread late at night the day before you plan to bake. I typically bake on Sunday, so I start on Saturday night. Add 30 grams of starter into a large bowl (that's about two tablespoons, but if you bake often, a digital scale is really indispensable), then dissolve it in 60 grams of warm water, and add another 60 grams of flour (for this stage, I prefer to use the rye/wheat mix I feed my starter wit. Yup, I did say "feed". ) Mix everything into a paste and cover your bowl with some sort of non-airtight lid.</p>

					<p>Let the mixture ferment for 12 hours. In my chronology, this brings me to Sunday morning. Your leaven should look much wetter than the paste did the night before, and filled with a multitude of air bubbles. Now comes the beer part.</p>

					<p>Pour the entire 500 ml bottle of your beer into the bowl. As the beer breaks the surface of bubbled-up leaven, its pieces should float on top of the liquid (this is, in fact, the best way to test if your starter was vigorous enough. If it wasn't, sadly there isn't really a way to go back in time and invigorate it).</p>

					<p>Next add flour; in this case, I used 500g of whole wheat and 250g of white flour. The dough turned out just a little bit denser than I hoped, so for future use I would change white four to 200 grams. Mix flour and dissolved starter with a wooden spoon and leave the mixture for about a half hour. Flour will absorb the liquid, developing gluten strands making kneading considerably easier and less messy. The fancy term for this process is autolyse (and ohh, what a sophisticate I am). </p> 

					<p>When the liquid is absorbed, add salt. For this recipe, I’m using 15 grams of coarse sea salt.</p>

					<p>Next is kneading, the only strenuous part of the process. Some techniques call for what can be described as a rather severe kneading, throwing the dough on a work surface and pounding it will all of baker’s might. Somewhat on the other end of the spectrum is Chad Robertson, the author of my go-to bread baking book <i>Tartine Bread,</i> who suggests only incorporating the salt, and folding, or turning, the dough  every half hour for the first two hours. Here’s how Robertson describes turns:</p>

					<blockquote>"To do a turn, dip one hand in water to prevent the dough from sticking to you and grab the underside of the dough, stretch it up, and fold it back over the rest of the dough. Repeat this action two or three times so that all the dough gets evenly developed. This is considered one turn."</blockquote>

					<p>I prefer to do a little bit of kneading (5-10 mins) in the bowl when incorporating the salt, and then folding the dough afterwards, every half hour for four times. During the second turn, I normally add any extra ingredients; in this case, it is 250 grams  (well, maybe closer to 230 by the time I stopped munching on it) of cheddar.</p>

					<p>After the four turns left the bread rise for another two hours. At the end of its first rise, turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Let the dough rest for another twenty minutes. Then start forming a loaf by - you guessed it - folding the dough onto itself and gently shaping it into a desired shape (I prefer a cylindrical loaf I can place in a tin).</p>

					<p>The final rise is called proofing. For proofing, you could either use a floured basket or (in a much tidier manner) a tin. I line my tin with parchment paper; whether to do that, the decision is yours. Leave the shaped loaf to rise for another couple of hours.</p>

					<p>By the end of proofing the loaf should be close to double in size. It’s finally time for baking, and in my Saturday-Sunday routine, we’re well into Sunday evening. Preheat the oven to 500F. The final increase in volume at the beginning of baking is called oven spring; for maximum oven spring, the oven should be rather humid. Thus, when heating it up, place an oven-safe receptacle with boiling water on the bottom rack of the oven. When preheated, bread foes on the middle rack. Bake at 500F of 450F for twenty minutes, then remove the remaining boiling water, and decrease the temperature to 400F. Bake for another twenty minutes, for a total of forty.</p>
